## About

Build an AngularJS application with the following:

1. User authentication: Use Firebase to support authentication in your application, so that
   the first screen a user sees, asks them to login via their google account. If the user is
   detected to have been already authenticated, then directly take them to the 2nd page.
2. Text editor: Once logged in, show a large textbox on the page integrated with the
   [Medium editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) and allow the user to write
   content in this editor area.
3. Everything the user writes here, should be synced into the Firebase database in
   real-time for that userâ€™s account, automatically, without hitting a submit button.
4. When the user logs back in, retrieve their last written and auto-saved document and
   show it in the editor ready for editing.
5. Host your project using Firebase hosting and send us a link, along with your code on
   GitHub.
6. Bonus: Allow the user to enter LaTeX equations into the editor inside 2 enclosing $
symbols (e.g. $1+1=2\$) and once the user is done typing them out, render the actual
   equation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
